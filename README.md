## About Me
I've been immersed in Web3 for 2.5 years, deeply involved in the crypto space in various capacities. As a node-runner, I've supported over 10 nodes (StarkNet, Aptos, Minima, KYVE, Forta, etc.). Additionally, I've authored smart contracts on several Layer 2 solutions like StarkNet and Arbitrum. My involvement extends to participating in testnets on Rollups or Layer 1 blockchains such as Aptos, Sui, Avalanche, Kiln Testnet. Lastly, I've been an early adopter and tester for a multitude of projects.
